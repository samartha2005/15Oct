    "    Constructor: The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. \n",

    "    Regular Method: Regular methods perform various operations and tasks on the object's attributes. \n",
    "                   They can be used to manipulate or interact with the object's data.\n",

    "                 It is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
    "    Regular Method: Regular methods have arbitrary names that are chosen by the programmer when defining the method.\n",

    "3.Arguments:\n",
    "    Constructor: The __init__ method takes at least one argument, self, which represents the instance of the object \n",

    "                    and manipulate the object's attributes. They can also take additional parameters as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Invocation:\n",
    "    Constructor: The constructor is automatically invoked when an object is created. \n",
    "                 You don't need to call it explicitly; it runs as soon as the object is instantiated.\n",
