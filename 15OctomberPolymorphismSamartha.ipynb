    "'''\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python offers several significant benefits in terms of code reusability and flexibility in programs. Here's an \n",
    "explanation of these advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**:\n",
    "   - **Generic Code**: Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different types as long as \n",
    "                       they share a common interface. This means you can create functions, methods, or classes that are more \n",
    "                        versatile and can be reused across various parts of your program.\n",
    "   - **DRY Principle**: Polymorphism promotes the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Instead of duplicating code for \n",
    "                       handling each specific type, you can write code once and apply it to multiple types, reducing code \n",
    "                       duplication and maintenance efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - **Adaptability**: Polymorphism makes your code more adaptable to changes. When you need to add new types or modify\n",
    "                       existing ones, you can do so without fundamentally altering the existing code. You only need to ensure\n",
    "                        that the new types adhere to the common interface.\n",
    "   - **Plugin Architecture**: Polymorphism is essential for building plugin architectures, where external modules can extend \n",
    "                           the functionality of an application without changing its core code. Plugins can implement the \n",
    "                           common interface, and the main program can interact with them polymorphically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Maintainability**:\n",
    "   - **Easier Debugging**: Polymorphic code tends to be more organized and concise, making it easier to debug and maintain.\n",
    "                           When you update a common method or interface, it automatically applies to all related types, \n",
    "                            reducing the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies.\n",
    "   - **Separation of Concerns**: Polymorphism encourages a separation of concerns. Each class or type focuses on its specific\n",
    "                               behavior, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage. This separation improves \n",
    "                               code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - **Scalable Design**: Polymorphism supports a scalable and extensible design. As your program evolves and new features or\n",
    "                       types are introduced, polymorphism ensures that the existing code can gracefully accommodate these \n",
    "                        changes, without causing widespread disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - **Information Hiding**: Polymorphism promotes encapsulation and information hiding. Users of a class or function need not\n",
    "                           concern themselves with the implementation details of different types; they can interact with \n",
    "                           objects through a common interface. This abstraction simplifies the interaction with complex \n",
    "                           systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing and Debugging**:\n",
    "   - **Testability**: Polymorphic code is often easier to test. You can create unit tests that apply a variety of objects to \n",
    "                   ensure they conform to the common interface. This simplifies the testing process and improves test \n",
    "                   coverage.\n",
    "   - **Debugging Ease**: Debugging becomes more straightforward because you have a clear, well-defined structure. You can\n",
    "                       focus on issues related to individual types without worrying about the overall program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, polymorphism in Python provides code reusability, adaptability, maintainability, and scalability, making your \n",
    "programs more robust and easier to develop and maintain. It aligns with principles like the DRY principle, separation of \n",
    "concerns, and abstraction, which are essential for writing clean and efficient code.\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Dynamic polymorphism, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented \n",
    "programming. It allows different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class, and method calls are resolved at \n",
    "runtime based on the actual type of the object. Dynamic polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with objects of\n",
    "various classes, as long as they adhere to a common interface (i.e., share method names and signatures).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, dynamic polymorphism is achieved through the use of inheritance and method overriding. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: You create a class hierarchy where subclasses inherit from a common base class. The base class defines a method \n",
    "that serves as a common interface.\n",
    "Method Overriding: Subclasses override the methods defined in the base class. This means they provide their own \n",
    "implementations of these methods, which may have different behavior specific to each subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Late Binding: When you call a method on an object, Python determines at runtime which method implementation to invoke based on \n",
    "the actual type of the object. This is late binding, and it's a key feature of dynamic polymorphism.\n",
